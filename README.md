# Multiprocessing with Python
This repo contains python scripts that demonstrates what's available in python multiprocessing package. All of the scripts should run with Python 3. (I have used python 3.6.1)

There is a folder "Bin Packaging" which shows the scripts to run the algorithm using single process and multiple processes. The scripts can be run from the command line by passing the input file path, output file path.
